Q1: What is Machine Learning?

Answer:
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for the task.

Example: Spam email detection, house price prediction.

Key idea: Instead of writing rules, we give data and let the system learn patterns.


Q2: What is a Machine Learning Model?

Answer:
A model is the mathematical representation of learned patterns from data. It can take inputs and produce predictions.

Represented as 𝑓(𝑥;𝜃) where:
    x = input features
    θ = parameters learned during training
    f(x;θ) = output prediction
Example: Linear regression model → y=wx+b, where w and b are learned.

Q3: Difference between Algorithm and Model?

Answer:
| Term      | Explanation                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm | Step-by-step procedure used to train a model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) |
| Model     | The trained version of the algorithm with learned parameters                          |

Example:
Algorithm: Random Forest
Model: Trained forest that predicts new data


Q4: Types of Machine Learning

Answer:

Supervised Learning -> Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs)

Example: Predict house prices, email spam detection

Unsupervised Learning -> Learns patterns from unlabeled data

Example: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

Reinforcement Learning -> Learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards

Example: Game AI, self-driving cars


Q5: Examples of Supervised vs Unsupervised

Answer:
| Type          | Example                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Supervised    | Predict student grades from hours studied  |
| Unsupervised  | Group customers based on shopping behavior |
| Reinforcement | Training a robot to walk using rewards     |


Q6: Steps in Machine Learning Workflow

Answer:
Data Collection – Gather raw data
Data Preprocessing – Clean, handle missing values, encode, scale
Feature Engineering – Create meaningful input features
Train-Test Split – Separate data to train and evaluate the model
Model Selection & Training – Choose algorithm and train
Evaluation – Use metrics to check performance
Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimize model parameters
Deployment & Monitoring – Put model in production and track performance


Q7: What is Data Preprocessing? Why is it important?

Answer:
Data Preprocessing is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data before feeding it into a machine learning model.

Importance:
Real-world data is often noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent.
Preprocessing improves model accuracy and convergence.
Prevents problems like overfitting, bias, or poor generalization.

Key Steps:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling / normalization
Outlier detection & handling
Feature selection & feature engineering


Q8: How do you handle missing data?

Answer:

Methods:
Delete rows – if missing values are few
Mean / Median / Mode Imputation – numeric or categorical
KNN Imputation – predict missing values using nearest neighbors
Regression-based Imputation – predict missing values from other features
“Missing” category – for categorical variables with many missing values

Example:
Age column has missing values → replace with median age


Q9: How do you handle categorical data in ML?

Answer:
Techniques:

Label Encoding – converts categories into integers (ordinal)

One-Hot Encoding – creates binary columns (nominal)

Target Encoding – replaces category with mean of target variable

Binary Encoding / Embeddings – reduces dimensions for high-cardinality features

Q10: How do you handle categorical data in ML?

Answer:

Techniques:
Label Encoding – converts categories into integers (ordinal)
One-Hot Encoding – creates binary columns (nominal)
Target Encoding – replaces category with mean of target variable
Binary Encoding / Embeddings – reduces dimensions for high-cardinality features


Q11: Why do we scale or normalize features?

Answer:
Scaling ensures features are on the same scale, which is important for distance-based algorithms (KNN, K-means, SVM) and 
gradient-based optimization (Neural Networks).

Methods:
Min-Max Scaling → scales to [0,1]
Standardization → mean = 0, std = 1
Robust Scaling → median and IQR, robust to outliers


Q12: What is an outlier? How do you handle them?

Answer:
Outlier: Data points significantly different from other observations.

Detection Methods:
Z-score (abs(z) > 3)
IQR method (Q1 - 1.5IQR, Q3 + 1.5IQR)
Boxplot visualization
Isolation Forest or DBSCAN

Handling Outliers:
Remove
Cap / Winsorize
Log transformation
Use robust scaling


Q13: What is multicollinearity and how to detect it?

Answer:
Multicollinearity: When independent features are highly correlated.

Detection:
Correlation matrix (heatmap)
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF > 5 → high correlation)

Fix:
Remove correlated features
Combine features
Apply PCA
Use regularization (L2 reduces multicollinearity)


Q14: What is train-test split and why is it important?

Answer:
Split dataset into train and test sets.
Train set → model learns patterns
Test set → evaluate performance on unseen data

Common Split: 70% train, 30% test or 80-20.
Importance: Prevents overfitting and ensures generalization.

Q15: What is cross-validation?

Answer:
Technique to assess model performance reliably.
Common types: k-fold CV, Stratified k-fold CV
Helps in hyperparameter tuning and reduces variance compared to a single train-test split

Example:
5-fold CV → dataset divided into 5 parts, each part is used once as test set
